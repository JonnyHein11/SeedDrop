Ok bitches this is how you set your shit up:

1. At the top left theres a dropdown called "branches"

2. Find the one with your name and go to it, these are the only files you will edit
    DO NOT EDIT FILES ON OTHER PEOPLE'S BRANCHES
    
3. Download all of the files in your branch.

4. Keep them in a folder just like they are on here. So all of those .dll files and .cpp files and shit should be in the same folder
    and the assets folder should be inside that.
    
5. The folder where all of that downloaded shit is, is the folder you will work in from now on

6. Open up the PA9 solution file and all of the other shit (cpp and .h files) should be there

7. Now you have to link all the libraries (you need sdl2 and SDL images)
      you can google SDL then go to the page, find SDL 2.0 and download the one that says VISUAL C++
      
      You can get the images one from the download link in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrWQsuDT3NE
            download the dev folder from the video, then follow the video instructions to link your libraries 
            
8. You're done. Now you can work on your parts in the folder you downloaded, then upload your finished files back TO YOUR OWN BRANCH
   and I will commit the changes to the master branch (which is teh final product branch)
